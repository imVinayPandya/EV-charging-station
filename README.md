## EV Charging Station Simulator

This project contains 3 sub folders and each sub folder contains a different task. Each directory has its own README file that contains instructions on how to run the task.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- NPM
- Docker and Docker Compose - to run database (optional)

For Node I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple versions of Node.js. I have used Node v20.2.0 in this project.
